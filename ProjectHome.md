This is an extension of the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) component of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). A resolution component has been added to the basic DRT machinery: Following van der Sandt 1992, it handles both anaphora and presupposition resolution. Anaphora resolution builds on the ideas of Blackburn & Bos 1999, taking into account syntactic information, thematic roles and antecedent proximity. The presupposition resolution component improves on the algorithm due to van der Sandt by making use of ontology. An inference component checks the readings generated by the resolution component for admissibility. A temporal component adds a simple handling of temporal conditions. It borrows heavily from the work on tense and aspect by Kamp & Reyle 1993.
